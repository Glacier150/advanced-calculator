# Advanced Calculator

This calculator is meant to be a beginner Python project. I primarily intend to practice my use of functions, although I may also get some experience with libraries.

I hope this will somewhat develop my skills, and although calculators can be pretty simple, I want to pack as much as I can into this one, hence why I refer to this as an 'Advanced Calculator'.
